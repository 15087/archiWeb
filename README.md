- [DataFixtures](https://github.com/15087/archiWeb/tree/main/archiLog/src/DataFixtures)

Fixtures are used to load a “fake” set of data into a database that can then be used for testing or to help give you some interesting data.

- [Form](https://github.com/15087/archiWeb/tree/main/archiLog/src/Form)

Symfony provides a “form builder” object which allows you to describe the form fields using a fluent interface. Later, this builder creates the actual form object used to render and process contents.
You will find the forms for the creation of a category and/or an ad.

- [Repository](https://github.com/15087/archiWeb/tree/main/archiLog/src/Repository)

Repositories are design patterns that encapsulate queries to the database.
